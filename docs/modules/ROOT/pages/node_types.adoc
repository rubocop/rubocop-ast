= Node Types

This is a partial list of the node types parsed by the AST and corresponding methods and information associated with them.

`RuboCop::AST::Node` defines some additional methods on certain node types by giving them a separate class. You can see the method definitions in the https://rubydoc.info/github/rubocop-hq/rubocop-ast/RuboCop/AST/Node[API documentation].

For full information, please see the https://github.com/whitequark/parser/blob/master/doc/AST_FORMAT.md[parser documentation]. This page will act as a quick index to that page, which has more examples and fuller explanation of the different location pieces. You can also see a full AST for yourself by running `ruby-parse --legacy -L -e "ruby(code: 'here')"`.

There are a few "meta-types" of nodes that will be mentioned in descriptions:

* Expression nodes: any expression that returns a value - variables (`lvar`, `ivar`, `cvar` etc.), `send` or `csend`, `const`, `self`, any literal value (`int`, `str`, `nil`, etc.), or control statements like `if`, `case`, `begin`, etc.
* Assignment nodes: Any node that assigns a value. `lvasgn`, `ivasgn`, `cvasgn`, `gvasgn`, `send` (e.g. `self.foo = 5`), or `csend`.
* Body statement: This can be essentially any node except those that must be nested (like `args` or `mlhs`). Typically it comes as the children of a node that can contain arbitrary code, like `def` or `class`. This will always be a single node which is either an expression, a `begin` node, or `nil`.

== Location Information

There are different parts of the source map you can get from the node, by calling `.loc` on it. Every node has an `expression` value which
usually represents the entire node, but others have additional fields.

The following fields are given when relevant to nodes in the source code:

[cols="m,a"]
|=========
|Field|Description
|assoc|The fat-arrow: `=>` used in the body of rescue clauses (`resbody`), not in a hash `pair`)
|begin|* Start of parentheses or square brackets `(` or `[`
* Start of `do..end` blocks (containing the `do` keyword)
* `then` keyword
* `begin` keyword
* The first symbol in literals (like `"` for strings or `:` for symbols)
|colon|The `:` symbol, used as part of a ternary (`:`)
|dot|The `.` or `&.` operator used for `send` and `csend` nodes.
|double_colon|The `::` operator
|else|The `else` or `elsif` keyword
|end|* End of parentheses or square brackets `)` or `]`
* The `end` keyword
* The last symbol in literals (like `"` for strings)
|heredoc_body|The body of a string in heredoc format.
|heredoc_end|The end of the heredoc statement.
|in|The `in` keyword (as in `for..in`)
|keyword|Any text-based keyword, like `begin` or `and`, with the exception of other keywords handled by other fields. This will include the full string containing the keyword.
|name|Used when *defining* something (like `const` or `arg`).
|operator|Any symbol representing an operator, like `*` (splat) or `\|\|=`.
|question|The `?` symbol used as part of a ternary (`if`)
|selector|Used for method invocation (`send` / `csend`) or operators that are actually methods (like `+`)
