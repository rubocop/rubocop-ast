= RuboCop AST

This gem introduces two core classes of RuboCop:

* `RuboCop::AST::Node` - this is an extension of the https://github.com/whitequark/parser/[`parser`] gem's `Node` class, which adds a simpler and more powerful object-oriented API to make it easier to work with nodes.
* `RuboCop::AST::NodePattern` - a regular expression-style method to traverse and match nodes in an Abstract Syntax Tree. See xref:node_pattern.adoc["Node Pattern"] to get yourself familiar with ``NodePattern``'s capabilities.

NOTE: This gem may be used independently from the main RuboCop gem. It was extracted from RuboCop in version 0.84 and its only
dependency is the https://github.com/whitequark/parser[parser] gem, which `rubocop-ast` extends.

== Rationale

While working with ``parser``'s AST representation is fairly easy (especially when compared to the AST of Ruby's built-in `ripper` library), there's still areas we felt could be improved:

* the canonical way to work with an AST node is to deconstruct the node in array-like fashion, which results in code that's hard to read
* looking for complex AST node patterns requires a lot of boilerplate code
* there's no easy way to tell apart AST nodes of certain types - e.g. prefix vs postfix conditionals
* there's no easy way to grab the parent node of some node

Enter `rubocop-ast`, which aims to solve those problems. This library evolved for years as part of RuboCop and was eventually spun off in the hope that it might be useful
for other projects built on top of `parser`.

`RuboCop::AST::Node` provides a wrapper around ``parser``'s `Node` class (in other words, `RuboCop::AST::Node < Parser::AST::Node`). In addition to a number of methods to make it easier to work with, the wrapper class also provides ways to inspect the *parents* of nodes, which the `parser` nodes do not support.

Here are a few examples using `parser` and `rubocop-ast`:

[cols="a,a"]
|======================
|`parser`|`rubocop-ast`
a|
[source,ruby]
----
# type = :if
is_if = node.loc.keyword == 'if'
if_branch = node.children[1]
else_branch = node.children[2]
has_elsif_branch = node.children[2].type == :if && node.children[2].keyword == 'elsif'
----
a|
[source,ruby]
----
# type = :if
is_if = node.if?
if_branch = node.if_branch
else_branch = node.else_branch
has_elsif_branch = node.elsif_conditional?
----
a|
[source,ruby]
----
# type = :hash
pairs = node.children
pairs.each do \|pair_node\|
  key = pair_node.children[0]
  value = pair_node.children[1]
  do_something(key, value)
end
----
a|
[source,ruby]
----
# type = :hash
node.each_pair do \|pair_node\|
  do_something(pair_node.key, pair_node.value)
end
----
|======================

Sample usage:

[source,ruby]
----
class MyRule < Parser::AST::Processor
  include RuboCop::AST::Traversal

  def on_sym(node)
    puts "I found a symbol! #{node.value}"
  end
end

source = RuboCop::AST::ProcessedSource.new(code, 2.7)
rule = MyRule.new
source.ast.each_node { |n| rule.process(n) }

In RuboCop AST, you can specify Prism as the parser engine backend.

If running through Bundler, please first add `gem 'prism'` to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'prism'
```

By specifying `parser_engine: :parser_prism`, parsing with Prism can be processed:

```ruby
# Using the Parser gem with `parser_engine: parser_whitequark` is the default.
ProcessedSource.new(@options[:stdin], ruby_version, file, parser_engine: :parser_prism)
```

This is an experimental feature. If you encounter any incompatibilities between
Prism and the Parser gem, please check the following URL:
